The artefact ListingWithDependencies_jar/Listing.jar (size around 17mb) embeds all the dependencies from the
iText7, scala, and Apache logging libraries that are used here in the Listing program. It is runnable without
additional support. IT IS NOT BUILT AOUTOMATICALLY WITH THE PROJECT.

The file, out/Listing.jar (size around 18kb) simply references my locally-installed
versions of the jars on which the listing program depends. It can be made, along with its (trivial) shell
script, out/listing by invoking makeListing. The script and one of the jars can be placed anywhere on
your path.
