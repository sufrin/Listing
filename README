The artefact PDF.jar implements a listing program whose main object is Listing. 
The jar itself is huge because it embeds all the dependencies from the
iText7 and scala libraries, as well as  Apache logging.

A smaller artefact, Listing.jar which simply references my locally-installed
versions of these jars, rather than copying them into PDF.jar,
can be made by invoking makeListing.
